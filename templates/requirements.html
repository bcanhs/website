			<h4><b>If your application is denied, here are possible reasons:</b></h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Your application may be denied because your cumulative GPA was not at least a 3.500, hence missing the pillar of scholarship.</li>
				<li>Your application may be denied because the number of completed community service hours was not at least 40 hours.</li>
				<li>Your application may be denied because your essay on scholarship did not demonstrate the qualities of scholarship. Scholarship is not only measured in oneâ€™s GPA; it is the enjoyment of learning and the passion for knowledge.</li>
				<li>Your application may be denied because your essay on leadership did not demonstrate the qualities of a leader. Leadership is exhibited in managing multiple components and diverse people toward a common goal. Leaders typically gain their skills and experience through leadership positions in and out of school (e.g. Vice President of Class Council).</li>
				<li>Your application may be denied because your essay on service did not demonstrate service. Service is exhibited in cheerfully assisting visitors, teachers, and students and volunteering dependable and well-organized assistance.</li>
				<li>Your application may be denied because your essay on character did not demonstrate character. A student of character is one who demonstrates trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship. The student complies with school regulations, avoids cheating and plagiarism, and takes criticism willingly.</li>
