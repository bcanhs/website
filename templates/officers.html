			<h4>NHS President</h4>
			<p>The president of National Honor Society has oversight responsibility for all Board endeavors, and works closely with the vice president to lead weekly Board meetings to discuss upcoming events, as well as propose new ideas. It is important for the president to make a presence at all NHS-sponsored events. Some requirements of being president include having to give opening remarks at the annual NHS Induction Ceremony and leading open meetings. Often times the PPO, Academy parent organizations, clubs, Administration, or faculty members will reach out to the NHS president with a question or request. Thus it is imperative that the president maintain positive relationships with these organizations/individuals as well. The president's most important job is to share enthusiasm for NHS with the Board and rest of the organization!</p>

			<h4>Historian</h4>
			<p>As historian, I am responsible for compiling memorabilia throughout the school year to chronicle NHS activities, as well as decorate and update the NHS bulletin board. I work closely with the other members of the board to really publicize what NHS is doing and keep members updated. As historian, your role in NHS will definitely be dynamic – you are really required to fill in and help out your fellow board members in various positions as they see fit. NHS is truly a team effort, and although you certainly will be busy with the work of a historian, you will also be expected to help out the other board members while also keeping on top of your own work.</p>

			<h4>Community Service Directors</h4>
			<p>Community service is a vital aspect of being a member of the National Honor Society, considering service is one of the four pillars of NHS. This position is one that is relatively new to the NHS Board, but is one that is extremely important. This position requires making sure every member meets their community service requirements for NHS and BCA. It also requires the proper documentation and management of the hours that each member completes through NHS sanctioned events on the NHS database. In addition, a wide variety of internal and external community service opportunities must be organized, so there is something that appeals to all members. This is the primary responsibility of this position and is one that must be attended to in a timely manner so that opportunities are available to members throughout the year. While this position may require a time commitment outside of school, it is one that is extremely rewarding and helps to foster a fundamental part of being an NHS member.</p>
